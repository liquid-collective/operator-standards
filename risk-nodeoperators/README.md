## Developing an Ethereum Node Operator Risk Methodology 

Node operators (NOs) play an important role in the security and performance of the protocol. There is a clear need for robust operational controls and processes to maintain enterprise-grade security and performance standards. As such, performance must be assessed through a [risk-adjusted lens](https://alluvial.finance/risk-adjusted-reward/), evaluating the potential reward of participation in consideration of the degree of risk that must be accepted to achieve it.

Currently, there are no widely accepted standards for benchmarking the technical competency of Ethereum NOs. In order to uphold Liquid Collective's mission to be the most secure and transparent liquid staking protocol, it is necessary to establish a benchmarking process that can be used to objectively determine whether NOs maintain an enterprise grade standard for security, infrastructure, and other relevant categories.

<h2>What’s next</h2>
Members from Liquid Collective’s Node Operator Working Group are actively working on an open risk evaluation and benchmarking methodology as part of this NO Standards initiative&mdash;one that can be used to objectively determine if a node operator maintains an enterprise-grade standard for security, infrastructure, and other relevant risk categories. 

The first phases of the risk methodology will be published in this repository in the near future for community feedback.
